# AE-CodeCollection

A collection of codes written in different Programming languages like JS / PHP and god knows what elese


# Structure

There is folders in this repo, each parent folder represent the language that the files inside are written by. And each folder inside the parent folder is the utility/code it self.
	Each folder contains either a file called code or folder called code. Anyway the **Code** part is where the actual code is. Any thing outside the code file/folder is just made for when vieweing the finished product.

**Example**:
-> JS
	--> CelsiusAndFahrenheit
		--> index.html // For file view
		--> indes.css // For styling the view
		--> code.js // Contains the actual usable code

Folder **_design** can be ignored as it contains the design template used for viewing the code
